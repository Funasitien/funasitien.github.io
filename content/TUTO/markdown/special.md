Some characters in Obsidian/Quartz have strange abilities. Let's take a look on them

# 😀 Emojis
## `#️⃣` Symbol

The `#️⃣` symbol can be used to make reference of tags inside a page.
For example, `#️⃣Minecraft` will render #️⃣Minecraft .
**Little cap !** The `#️⃣` symbol is included in the tag embed. So you have to remove it (which actually remove the whole point of this guy) - or include it in your tag name with a regular hastag like #Minecraft.
## `*️⃣` Symbol
As seen up, emojis that represent characters are interpreted as CHARACHTER + BOX by Obsidian. So this symbol will actually be always in italic :*️⃣ . Yup, it's bugged.*
